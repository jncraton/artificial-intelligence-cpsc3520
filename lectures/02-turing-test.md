Artificial Intelligence
=======================

What is AI?
-----------

- Rationality - the ability to do the "right thing" vs comparison to human performance
- Thought processes and reasoning vs external behavior

---

> Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. 
>
> -Marvin Minsky (1968)

---

> A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human. 
>
> -Alan Turing (1950)

Turing Test
-----------

- Designed to determine if of a machine exhibits intelligent behavior
- Internal thinking or awareness is difficult to measure
- We instead focus on the ability of a machine to accurately imitate a human in conversation

Capabilities
------------

- Natural language processing - communicate like a human
- Knowledge representation - know what a human knows
- Automated reasoning - think like a human
- Machine learning - learn like a human

Kurzweil's Long Bet
-------------------

- A computer will pass the Turing Test by the end of 2029.

Do you think that a machine can pass the Turing Test by 2029?

Is it possible for an artificial intelligence to demonstrate creative thinking as described in the article?

---

> I think a computer program could think in a way that would be imperceptible from creative thinking, but it would still be relying on data from other entities.

---

> I will have to say no. Mainly due to computers not having a conscious mind or thoughts. So a computer can not come up with ideas or solutions of its own.

---

> I think it is possible, but only in the sense of rearranging pre-made building blocks in various ways. I think the primary thinking a computer program can exhibit is responding to a situation that has been thought of by the designer.

What was your overall opinion of this article?

---

> It was interesting and a good way to start thinking about what an AI is capable of, but it was also mostly based in opinion.

---

> I think the article was very good and easy to read. I normally don't enjoy reading articles unless it's about sports, but this one I felt drawn in and interested. It was very beneficial to me.


---

> I feel it was short for a blog post to be used for class learning, but it was relatively to the point. and I understand how I was intended to learn from the article.
