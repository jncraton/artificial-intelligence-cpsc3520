Early History
=============

Automata
--------

- Self-operating machine
- Follow pre-determined instructions
- May mimic lifelike behavior

Artificial Neurons
------------------

- Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch showed that idealized artificial neurons could perform simple logical functions in 1943
- First to describe what would be called an artificial neural network

Cybernetic Robots
-----------------

- Developed in 1940s
- Basic robots using analog circuitry
- On early example is the [turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(robot))

Games
-----

- Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers agent in 1951
- Games have been used since that time to measure performance

Cognitive Revolution
--------------------

- Intellectual movement toward the study of the mind and its processes
- Began to merge psychology, linguistics, computer science, anthropology, neuroscience, and philosophy
- Surpassed [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) as the primary psychological paradigm

Dartmouth Workshop
------------------

- 1956 summer academic workshop at Dartmouth
- Co-organized by Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon
- Began the modern field of AI

> The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.
>
> Workshop proposal

---

> An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.
>
> Workshop proposal

---

> We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.
>
> Workshop proposal
