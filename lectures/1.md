What is AI?
-----------

- Rationality - the ability to do the "right thing" vs comparison to human performance
- Thought proccesses and reasoning vs external behavior


> Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. 
> Marvin Minsky (1968)

---

> A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human. 
> - Alan Turing (1950)

---

> Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a human can do.
> - Herbert A. Simon (1965)
---

> In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.
> - Marvin Minsky (1970)

---

> My timeline is computers will be at human levels, such as you can have a human relationship with them, 15 years from now.
> Ray Kurzweil (2015)

---

> The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it. 
> - Stephen Hawking (2014)

The first 20 years
------------------

- 1950 to 1970
- Radid progress on many problems
- Playing checkers, solve algebraic word problems, etc
- Great optimism about solving all remaining problems in short order

First AI winter
---------------

- 1970s
- Outstanding problems proved to be very difficult
- Progress slowed
- Funding dried up

Expert System Era
-----------------

- 1980s
- Research focused on building an marketing expert systems, to make decision like a human expert in a particular field
- Commercially successful for a time

Second AI Winter
----------------

- 1990 to 2010
- Limitations of expert systems became apparent
- Funding and research in AI systems was again reduced

Present
-------

- 2010 to present
- Advances computing power and several important advances in neural networks, such as dropout made large neural nets feasible
- Large amounts of reasearch funding into AI from the private and public sectors

Agents
======

---

- Simple reflex - only know current precepts
- Model-based reflex - stores previous precepts
- Goal-based - choose actions to achieve a goal
- Utility-based - optimizes a utility function related to several goals
