Artificial Intelligence
=======================

> Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. 
> Marvin Minsky (1968)

---

> A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human. 
> - Alan Turing (1950)

---

> Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a human can do.
> - Herbert A. Simon (1965)
---

> In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.
> - Marvin Minsky (1970)

---

> My timeline is computers will be at human levels, such as you can have a human relationship with them, 15 years from now.
> Ray Kurzweil (2015)

---

> The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it. 
> - Stephen Hawking (2014)
