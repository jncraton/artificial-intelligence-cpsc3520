Overview
--------

- Rover launched as primary payload of NASA's Mars 2020 program
- Landed on surface via heatshield followed by parachute and sky crane

Ingenuity
---------

- Drone that docks with the rover
- Will attempt to execute the first powered flight from another planet

Route to Mars
-------------

- Launched July 30, 2020
- Arrived February 18, 2020 (~200 days of flight time)

Communication
-------------

- Radio communication is used to relay data from rover to Earth
- May be relayed by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
- Command and control information is delivered via radio

---

What is the minimum current communication latency from Earth to Mars?

---

Latency
-------

- Absolute minimum latency is distance over the speed of light
- Distance to Mars is currently 1.4 AU (200 million km)
- 200 million / 300 thousand = 666 seconds = 11 minutes
- 2x for round trip latency

---

Approximately 7 minutes elapse between atmospheric entry and landing, so how do we control the landing?

Automation
----------

- The landing is 100% automated
- We listen in with an 11 minute delay
- The spacecraft has direct control over all needed maneuvers

Key events
----------

- Atmospheric entry
- Separations
- Parachute deploy
- Landing

Jezero Crater
-------------

- Landing site selected because it appears to be the site of a former river delta and may include signs of fossilized life if it ever existed on Mars
- Includes hazards such as rocks
- Previous rovers had intentionally chosen relatively safe landing sites

Terrain Relative Navigation
---------------------------

- New mission critical technology that allows photos of the surface to be compared to prior data to adjust course to a safe landing site
