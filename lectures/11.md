Logical Agents
==============

Knowledge-based agents
----------------------

- Apply a reasoning process to knowledge representation to make decisions

Knowledge Base
--------------

- Central component of knowledge-based agents
- Stores knowledge as **sentences** in a knowledge representation language asserting facts about the world

Updates
-------

- Tell - Add new information
- Ask - query for information

Ontologies
----------

- Formal representations of knowledge in a domain
- Ontology engineering studies the methodologies for building useful ontologies

Categories
----------

- Group similar objects
- Reasoning often takes place at the level of categories
- For example, a self-driving car will make decisions about pedestrians as a category without considering which individual pedestrians are nearby

First-order logic
-----------------

- Treating categories as objects in first-order logic can provide useful reasoning tools
- Membership: ${Bob} \in {Students}$
- Subcategories: ${Students} \subset {People}$

Inheritance
-----------

- Reasoning can be inherited through categories
- If we know that people have birthdates, then we know that Bob has a birthdate

Taxonomies
----------

- We can use properties of objects to create further categories

$$
\begin{gather}
Orange(x) \land Round(x) \land \\ 
Diameter(x) = 9.5 \land x \in Balls \Rightarrow \\
x \in Basketballs
\end{gather}
$$
