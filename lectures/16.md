Basis
-----

- We commonly use the standard basis to represent vectors
- The standard basis vectors will have all components equal to zero, which the exception of one value that is one
- Standard basis vectors are therefore unit vectors

Vector Addition
---------------

- We can add two vectors by simply adding their components (assuming the same basis)
