Gradient Descent
================

Calculus
--------

- Math of continuous change
- Can be used to compute rate of change
- Can also be used to compute the area under a curve

Minimization
------------

What is the minimum value of $x^2 + 2x + 1$?

Calculus solution
-----------------

- Calculate the derivative
- Find zeroes to determine point where rate of change is 0
- This will correspond to a minimum or maximum

---

- It can be hard to find solutions to for certain systems
- What if we can't find the derivative?
- What if the derivative is expensive to compute?

Gradient Descent
----------------

- Pick a point on the original function
- Calculate the slope or gradient at that point
- Pick a new point in the direction of the gradient
