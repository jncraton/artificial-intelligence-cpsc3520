- How does the mind arise from the brain?
- Where does knowledge come from?
- How does knowledge lead to action?

Computers

- Can determine results by following rules
- Appear to be wholly different than our own minds
- Can solve many of the same problem, such as multiplication

Dualism
-------

- Distinction between mind and matter
- A purely physical mind would not have truly free will
- Descartes proposed that there is a part of our mind that exists outside of nature

Materialism
-----------

- The mind operating by the laws of physics is the mind
- There is no separate mind that exists outside of nature
