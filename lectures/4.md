History of AI
=============

> My timeline is computers will be at human levels, such as you can have a human relationship with them, 15 years from now.

> The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it.

The first 20 years
------------------

- 1950 to 1970
- Rapid progress on many problems
- Playing checkers, solve algebraic word problems, etc
- Great optimism about solving all remaining problems in short order

---

> Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a human can do.
>
> -Herbert A. Simon (1965)

---

> In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being.

> -Marvin Minsky (1970)

First AI winter
---------------

- 1970s
- Outstanding problems proved to be very difficult
- Progress slowed
- Funding dried up

Expert System Era
-----------------

- 1980s
- Research focused on building and marketing expert systems, to make decision like a human expert in a particular field
- Commercially successful for a time

Second AI Winter
----------------

- 1990 to 2010
- Limitations of expert systems became apparent
- Funding and research in AI systems was again reduced

Present
-------

- 2010 to present
- Advances computing power and several important advances in neural networks, such as dropout made large neural nets feasible
- Large amounts of research funding into AI from the private and public sectors
