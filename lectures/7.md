Search Algorithms
================

---

A search algorithms takes as input a search problem and returns a valid solution

Process
-------

- Begin at the start state
- Expand the node by considering possible actions
- Generate a new node for each resultant state
- Continue this process

Frontier
--------

- Nodes in the search tree that have not been expanded
- A node that has been generated (whether expanded or not) has been **reached**

---

How do we decide which node to expand next as we search?

Best First Search
-----------------

- Choose the node with the minimal value for some evaluation function
- e.g. shortest distance to the final destination

Breadth First Search
--------------------

- Expand all nodes on the same level of the tree before moving to the next level

Depth First Search
------------------

- Fully expand the first node before moving to the next

Perfomance
----------

- Searching a nearly infinite space will take nearly infinite time
- Using highly optimized software can help
- Using very powerful hardware can help

Heuristics
----------

- It is often much more efficient to pursue a course that is good enough, but not optimal
- We can employ various metrics to determine whether a course is likely to result in a positive outcome
