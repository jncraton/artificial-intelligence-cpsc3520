Monte Carlo Tree Search
=======================

Go
--

- Turn-based game typically played on a 19x19 board
- Players take turns placing a stone on the board
- Goal it to surround more territory than your opponent

Go complexity
-------------

- Hundreds of legal moves per turn
- Hundreds of total moves per game
- Total game tree complexity is approximately ${250}^{150}$ or ${10}^{360}$

Go Search
---------

- Search space is far too large even for a modest search depth
- e.g. searching 4 plies (player turns) ahead would be ${250}^4$ or 3.9 billion nodes
- Difficult to apply heuristics to determine who is winning a given position

Monte Carlo Method
------------------

- Algoithms that rely on random sampling to obtain results
- Used in physics, engineering, ray tracing, and applied statistics

Monte Carlo Tree Search
-----------------------

- Does not use heuristic evaluation
- Estimates the value of states by running simulations of complete games
- Average utility simply become win/loss percentage for simple games

Playout Policy
--------------

- How do we decide which moves to play in our simuations?
- Ideally, we would play optimal moves for both players, but if we knew these we wouldn't need MCTS
- Random moves can work for simple games

Pure Monte Carlo Search
-----------------------

- Runs `n` simulations for each legal move from the current game state
- Select the move with the highest expected utility
- Increase `n` improves performance and requires additional compute
